# project_in_aroca
In this project, we use two method to build a automatic model which can distribute the best transpoter to each product.\
The fitst one is main.ipynb which use the cmopany's rule to distribute tranpoter. The second one is NSGA-III which will use the result of ruled base as orginal genes, then iteratively update the feasible soltion.
